- Serial Audit Program
- A form, which will allow me to drop-down search [ text ] POST a valid serial-number.  accepts serial_number
- Returned result will contain a table-grid of service-calls, in descending order. 
	serial_number,model_number,(call_date,time alltime elements), call_type, total_parts, [meter_readings -> sum and count]

	serial_audit form brings me to a search, well allow for an additional search as well as the table.

  - Create a modal-popup for meters and parts associated with that call.
 
  Light number of service calls, check the JOINs on this, it shoudl be similar to this count.
