Help!
 
I need a page that will allow me to view service information on the following fields:
-          Serial Number
-          Model Number
-          Technician
-          Call ID
-          Call DateTime
-          Dispatch DateTime
-          Arrival DateTime
-          Complete DateTime
-          Calltype
-          Problem Code
-          Customer Number
-          Travel Time ( Difference between dispatch datetime & arrival datetime )
-          Maintenance Time ( Difference between complete datetime & arrival datetime ).
-          Total Parts (w/ Modal popup listing parts spent on the call )
 
Also, create a start-date and end-date filter ( with clear option ) so I can look at a specific month, week, date, etc.
 
Please make the columns sortable ( in both directions ) w/ visual cues.  I also want to only see 100 records at a time, so make the enable pagination on the resultset, in addition to the column sorting.
 
Oh, I need to be able to export two views in csv format.  One view is the current state – this page -- ( pagination, order, date-filters, etc ), and the other view is the entire result set – all pages -- ( order, date-filters, no-pagination ).
 
Let me know if you have any questions!
