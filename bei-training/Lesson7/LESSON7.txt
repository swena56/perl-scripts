Design a Service Information Dashboard
 
- Load 3 Month's worth of data into your database.
 
- Create a dashboard CGI application ( dashboard.cgi ), which will:
 
Display the Current ( or Most Recent ) Months data for the following elements:
 
- Total Calls
- Total Parts
- Total Serials w/ Calls
- Total Techs w/ Calls
- Total Models w/ Calls
 
 May's data
 DESC
If I click on "Total Calls", I would like to be able to see the following:
- Top Ten Calltypes by total calls for the month
- Top Ten Models by total calls for the month
- Top Ten Techs by total calls for the month
 Example:
Top Ten Models  ( May )
Model | Total Calls
 
If I click on "Total Parts", I would like to be able to see the following:
- Top Ten Calltypes by total parts cost for the month
- Top Ten Models by total parts cost for the month
- Top Ten Techs by total parts cost for the month
- Top Ten Parts by total parts cost for the month
 Example:
Top Ten Parts ( May )
Part-Number | Total-Parts-Cost
 
For any of the "Top Ten" items listed above, I want a clickable link, that would popup a d3 graph, showing me the trends for the past 3 months for that item.
 
So, if I have a "Top Ten Parts" list, and I click on the Part-Number, then I want to see a d3 trend graph of that part and that parts-total costs over the past-3-months.
