What is my mysql datatype for null?
How many branches are there?  My example dataset has two of them, how many exist in production?
	fm.meter_code
	SELECT *
	FROM fixmeter AS fm
	JOIN models AS m ON fm.model = m.model_number
	JOIN serials AS s ON fm.serial_number = s.serial_id
	# link by call_id why I already have the call_id
	#JOIN services AS ser ON fm.
	GROUP BY m.model_number;

How am I suppose to get fixmeter linked to fixserv.  Why would I link them in the first place, arnt these suppose to be tempary tables.
So the idea is that once I do a zip import, and the data is pushed to permanent storage, I can have the temp tables cleared? 



How my data diffs from home4 data.
My models table has an auto-imcrementing id as well as the model number.

My serials also keeps track of model_id, customer_id
My some of my base tables are using auto-incremented data, where the id seems to be different

select * from serials where serial_id = 20002;
select count(*) from serials;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    13117 |
+----------+
