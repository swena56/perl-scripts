Yesterday I spent my time putting all my project code in the same place, I have a sane folder layout for my cgi projects in my training respository. 

I got a bit further in my sql book.  Better understanding of order by.  I learned you can use numbers instead of the column names.  I cant picture a reason you would do that, but now nowing that, a video I saw a while ago about sql injection makes a bit more sense. 

I am also thankful of the jquery book I picked up a couple days ago.

I have not made alot of headway on lessc, I am werry of using it, in fear that I will waste  to much time.  I spend a bunch of time, playing with d3, and have grown a liking for xcharts.  Still looking for a reason why I should graph out my data.  

If I get frusterated with graphing, I will likely create some kind of base class for retreiving json, instead of just having a bunch of unorganized files to do it.
