What did I do?

Polished up my webapp, and studied jquery and sql.

Stuggles that I had?

Figuring out the best way to organize my code, and use the right tools for the job.

I have created the tables with appened html strings and an ajax call.
created the tables with jquery.
and created them with the template toolkit.

3 different ways- through an ajax function that returned manual html.
-jquery implmentation of a returned json data via post 
- ajax to return a template.

Overall after doing it the with all three, and realizing how much easier the template toolkit makes things.

Today I am going to look into learning how to use lessc, then I will convert my css.  
Then I hope to create a few other model popups, and confirm that I am getting the data back I expect.  



I dont really understand the correct way to use padding?  I see the examples on w3 schools, I did not immedietly seen the results I wanted.  
So, I just moved on to avoid wasting time on it.

10 oclock company meeting.

I have all ten fingers, so the fourth of July was a success.
For those who are not looking at the active microphone in the attendees list, my name is Andrew Swenson.

This is day 11 for me here at BEI, not counting the studying I have been doing on the weekend.


Training is going very well, and I am religously studying the related technologies.  Matt's training is by far the best training I have ever experienced, and I am very thankful.

I will be sending matt my BIO for posting on the website, when he gets back.  Soon after training, I will be diving deep into the knowhow of how 

But for now, I am putting my attention to connecting the knowledge firehose up to my head.
