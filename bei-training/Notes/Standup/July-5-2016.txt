What did I do?

Stuggles that I had?
I dont really understand the correct way to use padding?  I see the examples on w3 schools, I did not immedietly seen the results I wanted.  
So, I just moved on to avoid wasting time on it.

I have created the tables with appened html strings and an ajax call.
created the tables with jquery.
and created them with the template toolkit.

Overall after doing it the with all three, and realizing how much easier the template toolkit makes things.  I would have to say, I get it.  Things are very clear.
