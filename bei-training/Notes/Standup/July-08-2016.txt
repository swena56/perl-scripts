I was able to get some d3 graphing done, and display top ten lists.  Its been going rather smoothly.


  Yesturday I was working on my dashboard display, and something Jeremy said clicked for me.  I recalled him speaking about wasting time while attempting to position everything on his dashboard.  I noticed I was having the same problem, so from the sounds of it, Drawing out the website had good effects for him.  So today I figured I would give that a try.   I will get sketches of what I want the graphs to look like. That way I wont feel like I am trying to put a puzzle together with my eyes closed.

I am getting very close, its just getting all of my templates to mesh together.  A concern of mine is trying to figure out what should be updated on my dash board from searches.  

I am going to quickly glance through my import process, and make sure I am not in need of help there.

I found a 2012 database design book on a newsbin search.  Ill read some of that tonight while trying to wind down for the night.

 BEI app rule.  For june.



    Review data, concepts discusson
[+] issues with fixparla - sum cost, qty
[+] I am not going to want to drop all for production data.  remove that for good practice.  I will do this manually, every time.
[-] Verify data, is this all correct, files/datareview

[!!] Focus on Task completion 

	Task List
[!] Review queries, remove unecessary data
[!] Complete Drawing
[!] Top Ten Graphs for Each
[!] terminal plugin for sublime
[!] D3 Graph
[!] Read a chapter from my database design book.
[!] Clean up git

<!-- [% INCLUDE section/tables/top10/calltypes_by_totalcalls.tpl rendering_info = top_ten_call_types_month_index(dashboard_data.month_index) %] -->

Questions
[+] Is there 0 tech calls for the month of 4 and 5
