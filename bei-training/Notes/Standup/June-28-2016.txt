I struggled with query errors yesturday.  I my service INSERT query setup, but I get no data back due to not having calltype data.


Today I plan on initially glancing through my DB base to give my self peace of mind that everything works.  Then I am going to start diving into CGI and the template toolkit.
CGI
TEMPLATE

FOR TODAY
- call_types table	 
- locations table
- service_meters
- INSERT INTO service_meters
- service_parts
- INSERT INTO service_parts
- billing_meters
- INSERT INTO billing_meters
- write a script that looks at my permant 
- storage matches my raw data.
- run cat5e
- start of cgi setup.
- questions buffer.
- reset database script


Hard realization that I had was that I am moving to fast...
