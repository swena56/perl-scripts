What I did yesturday 
-Wired my self into the network instead of using an omni-directional wifi adapter expontentially improving my connection.  http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5439000653

I did a little work with CGI, but it was a bit premature.
  I had incorrectly implented and lacked a few of my transaction tables, so the catch up game has been rather humbling and stressful for me.  
  So I have have been working getting them correctly written into my schema.  After this standup I will be writing some test queries to make sure that I have the written correctly, so I can avoid any mixups today.






FOR TODAY
- call_types table	 
- locations table
- service_meters
- INSERT INTO service_meters
- service_parts
- INSERT INTO service_parts
- billing_meters
- INSERT INTO billing_meters

- storage matches my raw data.
- run cat5e
- start of cgi setup.
- questions buffer.
- reset database script
