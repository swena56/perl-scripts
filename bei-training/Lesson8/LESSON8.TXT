What did I do today?

I drew a sketched of every detail of the new design.   This gave me a vision of how I wanted to structure my code. When I attempted to do it all at once, and just caused delay and headache for myself. 

I started implementing table sorting client side, but realized pagination might get difficult by doing it that way.  
So overall slight hiccup in the begining, but things are going smoothly right now.

Help!
 
I need a page that will allow me to view service information on the following fields:
-          Serial Number
-          Model Number
-          Technician
-          Call ID
-          Call DateTime
-          Dispatch DateTime
-          Arrival DateTime
-          Complete DateTime
-          Calltype
-          Problem Code
-          Customer Number
-          Travel Time ( Difference between dispatch datetime & arrival datetime )
-          Maintenance Time ( Difference between complete datetime & arrival datetime ).
-          Total Parts (w/ Modal popup listing parts spent on the call )
 
Also, create a start-date and end-date filter ( with clear option ) so I can look at a specific month, week, date, etc.
 
Please make the columns sortable ( in both directions ) w/ visual cues.  I also want to only see 100 records at a time, so make the enable pagination on the resultset, in addition to the column sorting.
 
Oh, I need to be able to export two views in csv format.  One view is the current state – this page -- ( pagination, order, date-filters, etc ), and the other view is the entire result set – all pages -- ( order, date-filters, no-pagination ).
 
Let me know if you have any questions!
