* Review homework assignments
* Review Apache / CGI Execution
* Perl Training:
  - Modules
  () Database Interaction
* FixFile associations, ETL Cycle
 
* Homework:
  - Write a perl script, which uses Perl Modules, which will:
    * Create temporary table schema based off of specifications available in Office365. ( See attachment )
    ( Zip file is customer data file, see attachment `50600516_xxxxx.zip` )
    * Locate, test and extract the contents of a zip file, as an input argument to the program.
                - Test the file integrity: unzip -tqq $file | my @arr = grep(!/^\.{1,2}$/,readdir $DIR);
                - Extract the contents of the zip file into a tmp location:
                  * mkdir -p $dir
                  * unzip -xjoq $file -d $dir
                  * perldoc: opendir | https://stackoverflow.com/questions/205159/how-do-i-get-a-directory-listing-in-perl
                                 
    * Iterate through the contents of the zip file, matching the file to the temporary table for bulk loading.
               
    * Using MySQL's LOAD DATA INFILE, bulk insert the contents of [ fixserl, fixparal, fixserv, fixmeter ] into the temporary tables.
